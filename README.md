This is a code update for Stat. Mech's umbrella sampling code. 

* Update Dec. 4th: 
  + Class Particle can be used to store many useful information without worrying array index issue too much.
  + Overload the minus operator to handle the combination and difference in position between a particle and the rest of the particle in the list.
  - Still working on the compute forces
